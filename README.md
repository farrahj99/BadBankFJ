# BadBankFJ

I created a dynamic webpage for my class project that shows fake users that can create accounts on a banking app, log into it, deposit, withdraw and it also shows all of the data of the users. 

Technology: 

- JavaScript
- React 
- Node
- HTML


To run the webpage on your local server: 

- Clone the repository to your local laptop or desktop
- Install node.js
- CD into this folder on the terminal
- Then run this into the terminal: npm install -g http-server
- Then run this: http-server 
- Then you should see something like this:

Now, navigate to the URL listed (in the case of this screenshot, that would be 127.0.0.1:8080 or http://192.168.1.153:8080).
